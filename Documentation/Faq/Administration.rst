Upgrade

**Q**: Can I upgrade an existing site to use the latest TYPO3 version with "Pizpalue"? The objective is to maintain the
page tree and the content elements.

**A**: The distribution imports a default page tree when being installed the first time. In case this isn't desired
the file :file:`typo3conf/ext/pizpalue/Initialisation/data.xml` as well as the folder
:file:`typo3conf/ext/pizpalue/Initialisation/data.xml.files` need to be deleted prior installing the distribution
for the first time. To upgrade TYPO3 and install the distribution without importing the page tree the following steps
might be carried out:

#. Uninstall all extensions
#. Upgrade TYPO3
#. Download the zipped version from Pizpalue from Github
#. Delete the file :file:`../Initialisation/data.xml` as well as the folder :file:`../Initialisation/data.xml.files`
#. Upload the extension to the server
#. Install the extension
#. Include statics for root template
#. Include Page TS config on root page (page properties - Resources)
