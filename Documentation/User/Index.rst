   "Grid Elements"-tab in new content element wizard

.. hint::
   Editing the "Appearance"-properties from a grid element doesn't alter the
   rendering hence the selections for "Frame" or "Space Before" have no influence
   to the contents appearance in the page.

   .. figure:: ../Images/User/GridElements_Appearance.jpg
      :alt: Appearance settings for grid elements don't change the rendering

      Appearance settings for grid elements don't change the rendering

.. tip::
   To influence the rendering the grid elements might be wrapped by a
   container grid element. The container grid elements allow to define
   additional classes.


.. _user-news:

News
====

For the news system a template "Image on top" is provided. It might be used to
render the image on top of the text (`see example <https://www.pizpalue.buechler.pro/das-plus/news/>`__).

.. _user-inlineLocalization:

Inline localization
===================

Sometimes it might be handy to have a text used at different locations available
in several languages. For this users might reference a translated text by using
curly brackets within the editor (`see example <https://www.pizpalue.buechler.pro/das-plus/lokalisierung/>`__):

.. tip::
   You might reference other content as defined by the
   `"getText" data type <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TyposcriptReference/DataTypes/Gettext/Index.html>`__.


.. _user-flexContentWidth:

Flexible content width
======================

To create content spanning the entire page width (`see example <https://www.pizpalue.buechler.pro/das-plus/flexible-inhaltsbreite/>`__)
one might use the "Full width" page layout in conjunction with the "Bootstrap
fix container" and "Full with container" grid elements:

.. tip::
   To further customize the containers css-classes, attributes and a wrapping
   container might be defined in the "Plugin Options" section from the
   "General"-tab:

.. _usr-revealFooter

Reveal footer
=============

An interesting feature is the footer to be revealed when scrolling down.
The user gets the impression like the content area forms a curtain being lifted
from the footer while scrolling to the end of the page.

To use this effect the constant "Reveal footer" can be set in the constant
editor. The constant can be found in "PIZPALUE: Customer - Frame".

.. note::
   This feature is using "position: fixed" which causes flickering in edge
   browsers. To correct the flickering "transform: translateZ(0)" is assigned to
   the preceeding sibling container. This cancels any fixed positioning in
   the sibling container. The situation might be improved by assigning
   "transform: translateZ(0)" to the last content element in the preceeding
   sibling element. In any case the element having "transform: translateZ(0)"
   assigned should be higher than the footer.


.. _usr-ppClasses

Piz Palue classes
=================

============================= ==================================================
Class                         Usage
============================= ==================================================
