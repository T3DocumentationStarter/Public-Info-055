Administration
==============

.. _admin_customize:

Customize
---------

The suggested way to customize the distribution for customer projects is to create an extension (e.g. user_customer)
and define the customer theme and functions in it (`see TYPO3 documentation
<https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/ExtbaseFluidBook/4-FirstExtension/Index.html>`__).

An example extension for that purpose is delivered and activated with the distribution. You might use it as your
starting point.

.. _admin_development:

Development
-----------

During development or maintenance phase two actions might be of interest:

#. Show under construction page
#. Enable code debugging

To temporarily show an under construction page the page "Baustelle" might be
moved before the root page where the code debugging can be enabled by activating
the debug mode in the "PIZPALUE: AGENCY" category from the constant editor.


.. _admin_configuration:

Configuration
-------------

Many aspects from the web site can be configured through the constant editor.

To ease configuration parameters were grouped. The following main categories
are available:

============================ ==================================================
Category                     Description
============================ ==================================================
PIZPALUE: GENERAL            A parameter in this category might be used for various module configurations
PIZPALUE: AGENCY             Everything related to the authority maintaining the site
PIZPALUE: CUSTOMER           Main customer related parameters
PIZPALUE: CUSTOMER STYLE     More detailed customer style related parameters
PIZPALUE: CUSTOMER SOCIAL    Definition from references to social networks
